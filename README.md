ðŸ“ŒAbout Us

We are a drug discovery team with an interest in the development of publicly available open-source customizable cheminformatics tools
to be used in computer-assisted drug discovery. We belong to the Laboratory of Bioactive Research and Development (LIDeB) of the
National University of La Plata (UNLP), Argentina. Our research group is focused on computer-guided drug repurposing and rational discovery
of new drug candidates to treat epilepsy and neglected tropical diseases.

**Similarity Heatmaps WebApp**

This WebApp builds a heatmap of molecular similarity. These plots of inter-molecular similarity (computed as Tanimoto similarity coefficient using Morgan fingerprints or other molecular fingerprinting systems) allow for a fast, visual inspection of the molecular diversity of the datasets, and also preliminary detection of clusters within a dataset. The resulting plots are downloadable as .png files through a simple right click on your mouse!.
